      Thresheld is a hybrid sound/video project that synthesizes personal experience, the study of seals and selkies in Celtic and Nordic folklore, and reverent imagination.

      It explores how we might feel held by our ancestors in our own experiences of liminality and  endeavors to connect creatively to lineages from which we may have been disconnected.

    <div class="paragraph">
      Sourcing representations of queerness in nature and the folklore of the artistsâ€™ lineages emerged from a longing to connect with the queer and trans ancestors whose existence is often invisiblized.  Seals are liminal creatures, of both the land and sea, and selkies are shapeshifters.

    <div class="paragraph">
      This work is an experimental collaboration between these creatural thresholders, the artist, as a queer person of fluid gender and sexuality, and their child (N) who is amidst the shapeshifting experience of adolescence. It is a gesturing towards a sense of belonging in fluidity and an invitation to practice presence in the ever-shifting waters of time and change.
